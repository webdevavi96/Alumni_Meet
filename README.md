# 🧑‍🎓 Alumni Meet

*Alumni Meet* is a web application developed for my college to connect students with their Alumni for future guidance and mentorship.

## 💡 Why Alumni Meet?

When I was in my final years, I faced several challenges:

1. Lack of proper guidance.  
2. Limited knowledge about the industry.  
3. No clear idea about what to do after college.  
4. Struggles in finding the right job opportunities.  

I thought — why not reach out to my Alumni for help?  
But there was another problem: *I had no contact information for any of them.*

To solve this, I decided to create a *platform where students can directly connect with Alumni* and get real-world guidance for their careers.

## 🔮 Future Updates

Exciting updates planned for future releases:

1. #### 💬 Live Chat

   Students will be able to chat directly with Alumni for instant guidance — without leaving the platform.

2. #### 👥 Follow System

   Users will be able to follow Alumni or Teachers (like Instagram or X) and see only relevant posts or blogs they are interested in.

*...and many more features coming soon! 🚧*

## 🧰 Tech Stack

Originally, I planned to build Alumni Meet using *Django*, but later realized that separating the frontend and backend would make future updates easier and cheaper to host.  
So, the project is now built on the *MERN Stack* (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js).

### Advantages

1. Frontend and backend are separated for better scalability.  
2. No framework limitations for features like Live Chat.  
3. Reduced server load and improved performance.  
4. More control over backend logic and frontend rendering.
